### Lisboa
It has been almost a month since my first post and a **lot** has happened already! The spring semester started at Georgia Tech OMSCS, I started my side project with the Play! Framework and Java,
and most recently returned from a weekend trip to Lisbon, Portugal. It was a fantastic first trip to Europe after moving to England (I've been to Europe many times before) and as such, I decided
to stray away from my planned tech talk and write about the trip. My goal is to share some itinerary and travel tips for Lisbon in hopes that they might be useful for others thinking about visiting.

Having been to many great cities in Europe, Lisbon did not disappoint. The sites were fantastic, the weather was perfect (considering English weather at this time), food was inexpensive, and the
Portuguese were friendly and inviting.

## Orientation of Lisbon
Lisbon is a vibrant, bustling, and culturally engaging capital city that has a rich history due to its location. As one of the most ancient cities in Europe,
Lisbon changed many hands between empires, some of which were the Romans, Moors, and the Spanish empires. Portugal was also the first global empire during the Age of Discovery, promoting its wealth, power, and status.

On All Saint's Day in 1755, Lisbon experienced an earthquake that registered 9.2 according to the now used Richter scale -- greater than the 2011 Japan earthquake. Much of the city was destroyed due to the
 earthquake itself and the fires, which started because of the abundant candles being used to observe the religious occasion. The destruction caused by the earthquake marked a decline in Portugal's wealth and power, however,
 the city itself cleared and rebuilt in a staggering amount of time. Today, the effects of the earthquake can be seen in the distinguishable differences in the layout and design of Lisbon between different neighborhoods.

## Travelling to Lisbon

### When to go
Travelling in **January** meant it was low-season in Lisbon, which meant there were few crowds and rarely any lines. This also meant that the many beautiful sights of Lisbon were easily photographed sans-people.
The weather was mostly bright and sunny, with temperatures around 50-60F.

### How to get there
There are quick and inexpensive flights to Lisbon from Stansted (most of my travel will be from London area airports) served by most budget airlines. The flight itself is around 2.5 hours.

### Where to stay
There are plenty of affordable and fantastic flats offered on AirBnB. The challenge is finding the right neighborhood to stay in. I stayed in a hostel in Alfama which is on the eastern side of the city.
The advantage of staying in Alfama is that it seemed particularly less touristy than Baixa (closer to the city "center"). Tram 28 and 12 were a short walk away and allowed quick travel into the Praca Figuera
and Martin Monez. As the only neighborhood that wasn't destroyed by the earthquake, Alfama's charm also benefits from it's original medieval street layout, look, and feel.

### Public Transportation
Lisbon is a walkable city, but in order to see each of the neighborhoods, Lisbon's public transportation is helpful and inexpensive. However, I found it a bit of a nuisance that most maps only printed either the
Metro **or** Tram lines -- not both. Nonetheless, the tram provided the easiest form of transportation, in particular the historic 28E and 12 trams. Do be mindful of pick-pocketers while enjoying the views from the tram.

## Travel Tips! 
* This applies to any travel where a cellular data connection isn't available: download an offline Google Map of the city. GPS still works and having a live map is incredibly helpful
* The LisboaCard may be helpful for travellers interested in visiting a lot of museums. Do some research to see which museum's you'd actually like to go to. In my case it was more economical
to travel using the VivaViagem card with the 24-hour pass on days that I stayed entirely in Lisbon, and the "Zapping" method for single rides.
* At sit down restaurants it is customary for preappetizers to be brought out, like bread would be brought out in the States. However, this food isn't free or complimentary. You can kindly
tell the waiter/waitress that you simply don't want it, or push it to the side and it will be collected later.
* Wear comfortable walking shoes. The cobblestone streets absolutely necessitate the need for proper footwear.
* Rick Steve's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rick-Steves-Snapshot-Lisbon/dp/1598805886">snapshot guidebook</a> is a great resource to read before and during the trip. Having it also gives you a €5 discount on the Inside Lisbon walking tour.
