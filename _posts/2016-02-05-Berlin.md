### Willkommen in Berlin
In February I traveled to Berlin for the first time and it has easily become my favorite European city travelled to thus far. I'm writing this post in May, so some details are hazy. Berlin is just so rich in history which is evident everywhere in the city. You don't need to go to a museum or read about it in a book. All of the past is right in front of you, ripe for the picking. Yet interleaved with the carefully chosen unrestored bullet-hole ridden walls, the sidewalk memorials to Holocaust victims, and remnants of the Berlin wall and the Cold war is a thriving and advanced city, hustling and bustling with intellectuals, politicians, technologists, and hipsters. I think there's more to be said about the city, but for now I'll move on. There's so much I didn't get to see in the 3 days I was there, so I hope to visit again soon.

## Orientation of Berlin ##
Berlin is a pretty big city, especially compared to the cities I've travelled to in the past. I would advise that you prepare a general itinerary so that you don't spend too much time on the U-Bahn. In my opinion, the historical East Berlin sector has some of the most interesting sights to see and you can spend 1-2 days just there. Museum Island, so called because it is an island filled with 5 different museums, holds interesting artifacts as well as the impressive Ishtar Gate and bust of Nephrotite. We only travelled to West Berlin a couple of times to go to restaurants out there.

## Travelling to Berlin ##

####When to go####
Travelling in **February** meant it was still technically low-season in Berlin, but we didn't encounter any closures due to the timeframe. But like Lisbon, this meant there were few crowds and rarely any lines. It was definitely a chilly trip, but what else can you expect when you travel to northern Germany in February?
The weather was mostly bright and sunny, with temperatures around 40-50F.

####How to get there####
There are quick and inexpensive flights to Berlin from Stansted served by most budget airlines. The flight itself is around 2.5 hours. We flew into Berlin Schonefeld ("Beautiful field") which unfortunately is on the outskirts of the city. You will need to take the S-Bahn into the city center (most likely Hackescher Markt or Alexanderplatz) and then transfer to the U-bahn after that. There are clearly marked zones which apply to the type of train ticket you buy. I highly suggest buying the train ticket as soon as you find an opinion ticket machine because the ticket line on the platform took over 30 minutes.

####Where to stay####
Since we were traveling during the low season, there were many deals at hotels that would otherwise be expensive. We stayed at the Monbijou Hotel located in the Hackesher Markt which was extremely convenient. It's a short walk to three major U-bahn stations that serve different lines. Our walking tour also started just outside of the hotel. There are also plenty of cafes, supermarket, and restaurants (perhaps not so authentically German, but good nonetheless) just outside of the hotel.

####Public Transportation####
Berlin is a large city, so I would plan out where you want to go beforehand. Also, download an offline map of the U-Bahn to get an idea of where you'd like to go. Make sure you buy and validate your ticket, because plain-clothes officers will regularly check your ticket on board. I would recommend getting a day-pass on the U-Bahn. It's worth the price and is less hassle then buying a ticket each time.

## Things to do ##
Instead of a 3-day itinerary, I've listed the must-sees in Berlin.

* <a href="http://www.viator.com/tours/Berlin/Discover-Berlin-Half-Day-Walking-Tour/d488-3817DISCOVER"> Walking Tour</a>: A walking tour is always a great way to get an orientation to the city. This particular tour gave an in depth history and view.

* Visit the <a href="http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/visits/kuppel/kupp/245686"> Reichstag</a>: The Reichstag was/is the seat of the German government, but has only recently been since the late 1999 after reunification. Prior to that, government was held in Bonn and East Berlin. There is free entry and audio tour of the Reichstag, but you do need to register in advance. I highly recommend visiting -- the dome provides an impressive views of the city and an excellent audio guide. And again... it's free.

## Travel Tips! ##
* This applies to any travel where a cellular data connection isn't available: download an offline Google Map of the city. GPS still works and having a live map is incredibly helpful
* If you are a student, bring your student ID or proof of enrollment for discounts to museums and tours.
* Rick Steve's <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rick-Steves-Snapshot-Berlin/dp/161238692X">snapshot guidebook</a> is a great resource to read before and during the trip
