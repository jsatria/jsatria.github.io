Hello and welcome to my blog... v2! Thanks for visiting! A bit about myself: I'm a software engineer originally from D.C. but now residing in Cambridge, UK. Besides tinkering with stuff, I travel, cook + eat, longboard, and play instruments (5 and counting). I've also got a brindle dachshund (weiner dog) named Hazelnut that craves attention 24/7.

This is now my second blog that I've embarked on and hopefully I'll post more regularly about all things tech, travel, and life. Stay tuned!
