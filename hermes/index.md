This is a temporary support page for Hermes, an iOS based application. Please direct any questions, concerns, and comments to jonathan.bytes@gmail.com

The app is a final deliverable term project for Georgia Tech's OMSCS 6460 course. It is a demonstration of a foreign language learning chatbot that uses Apple's Core Motion framework to teach elementary foreign language phrases using the theory of Total Physical Response.
